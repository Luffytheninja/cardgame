# Ìrìn Àṣẹ: Descent to Ilé-Ifẹ̀

A lightweight single-player terminal card game inspired by Yoruba mythology.  
The first 10 floors act as a guided tutorial that teaches:

- Àṣẹ (energy) management
- Attack/Block combat flow
- Enemy Intent reading
- Ifá 4x2 binary signature building
- Event choices and relic systems
- Mod-2 card transformation combos
- Deck cycling discipline

## Run

```bash
python3 game.py
```

## Controls

- Enter the card number to play it.
- `end` ends your turn.
- Follow prompts for event and relic choices.

## Tutorial Floor Highlights

1. **The Descent** — basic attack and Àṣẹ
2. **The Clay Vessel** — Block and Retain basics
3. **Eshu's Gaze** — enemy Intent icons
4. **Binary Signatures** — 4x2 Ifá matrix marks (`I` and `II`)
5. **The Crossroads** — blessing vs obstruction event
6. **The Elu Resistance** — first elite, multi-enemy encounter
7. **Addition Mod 2** — card-combo transformation (board wipe)
8. **The Inner Head (Ori)** — choose a permanent passive
9. **The Basket of Existence** — guaranteed treasure relic
10. **Rhythmic Cycles** — discard-to-draw loop mastery

## Notes
